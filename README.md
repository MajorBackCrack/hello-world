# hello-world

Cybersecurity dropout looking to reintroduce myself into the info-sec space.

I have never learned to code, but have started to try and learn.

Interested in the financial markets. More specifically derivatives, and cryptocurrencies.

I look forward to learning more on github and eventually collaborating with others.
